# Catgirl Sorting AI

An automated system for downloading SFW and NSFW catgirls, processing them with an image classifier AI, and saving them to their respective folders. Everything is built in python, make sure your computer can handle tensorflow if you plan to use the AI.

There is no training data in "train.zip" yet, in other words, create an empty folder named "train" first, and then run the download bots. Both the bots are configured to download 400 catgirls. Make sure to run the SFW Bot first, then the NSFW Bot. There will be issues if you don't. After that you can finally run the AI.

All the necessary code and directories are in the lovely package called "Compressed Catgirl AI Build.zip"

*A rule of thumb is to use your GPU for the AI as long as your GPU has a cuda score of 3.2 or higher
